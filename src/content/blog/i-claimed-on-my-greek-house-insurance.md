## A Real Home Insurance Claim Experience

I thought it might be helpful to share my own experience of making a claim on my Greek house insurance. Understanding the process before you need to use it can make a stressful situation much easier to handle.

## What Happened

A severe storm caused water damage to part of our roof, which led to water coming into the house and damaging a ceiling and some furniture. Not a huge disaster, but definitely something that needed professional repair.

## The Claims Process

I contacted our insurance broker (that's what we do!) immediately. Here's what we did:

- **Documented everything** - We took photos of all the damage before touching anything

- **Reported promptly** - We notified the insurance company within 24 hours of discovering the damage

- **Got estimates** - We obtained written estimates from local contractors for the repairs

- **Kept receipts** - Every expense related to preventing further damage was documented

## The Outcome

The claim was processed smoothly. An assessor visited the property, reviewed our documentation, and the claim was approved. The insurance company paid out the repair costs minus our excess (deductible).

## Tips from Our Experience

- Know your policy before you need it - understand what's covered and what your excess is

- Take photos immediately - document everything before any cleanup

- Report quickly - most policies require prompt notification

- Keep all receipts - even small expenses for emergency repairs

- Use your broker - that's what we're here for!
