## Paying Road Tax (Teli Kykloforias) in Greece

Every vehicle owner in Greece needs to pay annual road tax (τέλη κυκλοφορίας). Here's how to do it.

## When Is It Due?

Road tax in Greece is due at the end of each year for the following year. Typically, the payment window opens in late November/December. You must pay before the deadline to avoid penalties.

## How Much Is It?

The amount depends on:

- Engine size (cubic centimeters)

- Vehicle age

- CO2 emissions (for newer vehicles)

- Vehicle type

Older, larger-engined vehicles generally pay more. Electric vehicles often have reduced or zero road tax.

## How to Pay Online

### Step 1: Go to the AADE Website

Visit the AADE (Independent Authority for Public Revenue) website and log in with your TaxisNet credentials.

### Step 2: Find Your Road Tax

Navigate to the road tax section. Your vehicle details should be pre-filled based on your registration.

### Step 3: Print the Payment Form

You can print the payment slip (if paying at a bank) or pay directly online via web banking or card.

### Step 4: Keep Your Receipt

After payment, print or save your receipt. You may need to show proof of payment if stopped by police.

## What If You Don't Pay?

Driving without valid road tax is illegal. You can be fined, and your vehicle plates may be confiscated. Additionally, unpaid road tax accumulates penalties and interest.

## Important Note

Road tax is separate from vehicle insurance. You need both to legally drive in Greece. If you need help with your car insurance, [contact us](/contact/).
