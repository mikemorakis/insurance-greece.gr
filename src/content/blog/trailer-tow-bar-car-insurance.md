## Insurance for Trailers and Tow-Bars

If you use a trailer or have a tow-bar fitted to your car in Greece, there are some important insurance considerations you need to be aware of.

## Does My Car Insurance Cover My Trailer?

This is a crucial question, and the answer is: it depends on your policy. Many standard car insurance policies in Greece do NOT automatically cover trailers. You need to check your policy carefully or ask your insurance provider.

## What You Need to Know

### Third Party Liability

If your trailer causes damage to another person or their property, you need to be covered. Some car policies extend this coverage to trailers while they're attached to your vehicle, but not all do.

### Damage to the Trailer Itself

Even if third-party liability is covered, damage to the trailer itself usually isn't included in standard car insurance. You may need separate trailer insurance for this.

### Tow-Bar Fitting

If you've had a tow-bar fitted to your car, you should inform your insurance company. Modifications to your vehicle should always be declared, and in some cases, fitting a tow-bar could affect your premium.

## Weight and License Requirements

Remember that depending on the total weight of your car plus trailer, you may need a different category of driving license. Make sure you're legally entitled to tow the trailer you're using, as driving without the correct license could invalidate your insurance.
