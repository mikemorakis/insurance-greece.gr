## Planning to get Health insurance in Greece? Read this first!

*Written by Stavros Tsichlis, Insurance Advisor at Insurance-Greece*

Some individuals skip health insurance due to cost concerns, but this approach leaves you vulnerable when accidents or illnesses occur unexpectedly. This risk increases significantly when living abroad, where language barriers and complex bureaucratic healthcare systems (IKA – EOPYY – PEDI and EFKA) complicate matters.

If you're considering health insurance options in Greece, evaluate these five critical factors:

### 1) The Insurance Company

Select carefully by examining the company's financial stability and track record. Ask about claim processing timelines and the firm's solvency margin. A qualified insurance advisor should answer these questions thoroughly.

### 2) Emergency Service

Verify that your advisor and company remain accessible around the clock. Confirm availability of 24-hour helplines and global air ambulance services for serious medical incidents.

### 3) Network or No Network?

Some insurers maintain specific doctor and clinic networks, ensuring pre-vetted quality providers who bill directly, eliminating large upfront expenses. Others offer provider freedom but require you to evaluate quality independently.

### 4) Read the Fine Print (Terms and Conditions)

Health insurance policies contain important clauses requiring careful review. Pre-existing conditions (like thyroid issues) may have waiting periods before coverage applies.

### 5) Ask, Ask, Ask!

Health insurance represents a significant financial commitment. Professional advisors must answer all questions truthfully and promptly. Referrals from satisfied friends provide valuable starting points.
