It has been a very straightforward procedure thanks to their kindess and patience. Not having a copy of the policies in English is very difficult but they always take the time to explain anything and everything \u2013 and never duck a question!",

    text: 'Stavros Tsichlis from Insurance-Greece.com proved to be a total and consummate professional when I enquired about home and vehicle insurance. He is linguistically skilled and with his wide knowledge of insurance he was able to reassure and guide me in excellent English through the complexities of Greek insurance \u2013 both within Greece and when traveling across Europe from Greece to the UK by car and return. His advice was without prejudice or pressure and, in addition, Stavros freely advised me about all other aspects of Greek life, he is always available either by phone or email should there be any enquiries. I can vouch for his honesty and integrity and I would certainly recommend Insurance-Greece.com without reserve.',

    text: "We had a problem with our car on the week end, a blown tyre. Unfortunately it turned out that the garage who sold the car to us did not include the jack or wheel brace and I could not change the wheel myself. We utilised Insurance-Greece.com's break down service under the terms of the policy. I feel that I must write to you to say how pleased we were with the service given by yourselves and the garage that came out. It was all done very quickly and in a friendly fashion. Had we been in our country we would have waited hours but this was all sorted in 45 minutes! The garage did every thing to make it as painless as possible. Please ensure that the efficiency of the garage is noted in your records and you may wish to pass this message on to them for their good will purposes and as a recommendation.",

    text: 'I would like to express my satisfaction with the service provided by Insurance-Greece.com Insurance Company. They provide a comprehensive range of policies and their prices are highly competitive. They have saved me several hundred Euros in premiums. In particular I have been impressed with the Health insurance policies they offer, which seem to me to give excellent value for money. I have also been impressed with the standard of their customer service. Mr Stavros Tsichlis, my first point of contact, speaks really excellent English and can explain the finer points of the various policies, which ensures you choose the one that is best suited to your circumstances. A claim I made recently was dealt with efficiently and fairly and the claims procedure was made straightforward by first-class service throughout. I would add that all the people I dealt with communicated in excellent English. I have no hesitation in recommending this company.',

I have been using the services of Insurance-Greece.com for some time now and during that time I have received a first-class service from Stavros \u2013 I insure my vehicles and my home with the Company.

    text: "I am writing to say how pleased I have been with the service given by Mr. Tsichlis and Insurance-Greece.com in my dealings with them in respect of my car insurance. I say this given the problems experienced over a number of years being an English person living in Greece and attempting to obtain suitable car insurance along the lines of English cover and also the difficulties in having to deal in Greek or through inadequate translation facilities and having found that invariably the cover I have requested has not been forthcoming or is a variant of what I have asked. It was a pleasure to deal with Mr. Tsichlis who speaks perfect English and who was able to obtain the cover that I wanted without any fuss argument and difficulty and at a competitive premium. Had it not been for the fact that I had already insured my home in Greece through an English insurance company, I would have placed the house insurance with him because on speaking to him it was obvious that I would have obtained better cover with him than with the English company I have insured with. It was a delight to have my phone calls and emails returned promptly efficiently and in a friendly and professional manner. From my own experience I would have no hesitation in recommending the services of Insurance-Greece.com to others.",
