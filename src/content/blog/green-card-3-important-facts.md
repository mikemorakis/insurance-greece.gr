## What is a Green Card?

The green card is an international certificate of insurance that proves that you have the minimum compulsory insurance required by the country you are visiting. Greece is part of the Green Card system which includes all EU countries plus some non-EU countries.

## Three Important Facts

### 1. You May Already Have One

Most Greek car insurance policies automatically include Green Card coverage for EU countries. However, you should always check with your insurance provider before traveling abroad. If your policy doesn't include it, you can usually add it for a small additional premium.

### 2. Keep It With You When Traveling

If you're driving outside of Greece, you should always have your Green Card with you in the vehicle. Police in other countries may ask to see it, and without it, you could face fines or even have your vehicle impounded. The card proves you have valid insurance coverage in that country.

### 3. It Only Provides Minimum Coverage

The Green Card only guarantees the minimum legally required coverage in the country you're visiting. This is typically third-party liability only. If you want comprehensive coverage abroad, you'll need to check if your policy extends full coverage to other countries or arrange additional insurance.
