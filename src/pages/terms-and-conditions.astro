        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to insurance-greece.com. These Terms and Conditions govern your use of our website and services. By accessing our site or requesting a quote, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Professional Status</h2>
        <p>Insurance-greece.com is operated by Stavros Tsichlis, a licensed Insurance Intermediary registered in Greece (Professional Chamber Registry No: 7841). We act as independent brokers, mediating between clients and legally operating insurance companies in Greece. We are not an insurance company.</p>

        <h2>3. Services Provided</h2>
        <p>We provide information and consultation services to assist expats and non-residents in finding insurance products (Health, Residence Permit, Property, etc.) in Greece. The final insurance contract is always between you (the client) and the Insurance Provider (the company).</p>

        <h2>4. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>When you fill out our online forms or provide details via email/PDF/online link, you are responsible for the accuracy of that data. Any errors in passport numbers, names, dates, medical data or other information may lead to the rejection of your application or compensation by insurance companies. Insurance-greece.com is not liable for issues arising from incorrect information provided by the client.</p>

        <h2>5. Residence Permit Insurance Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Our "Residence Permit Insurance" certificates are designed to meet the current requirements of the Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum. However, immigration laws are subject to change. We are not responsible for changes in government policy or specific requirements of individual decentralized administrations that may occur after the issuance of your policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Stavros Tsichlis / Insurance-greece.com shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of our services or the rejection of any visa/residency application by Greek authorities.</p>

        <h2>7. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>Cancellation and refund policies are governed by the respective insurance company's terms. As brokers, we will assist you in the cancellation process, but the final decision and refund rest with the insurance provider.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Greece. Any disputes relating to these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Rethymno/Crete, Greece.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>We process personal data (name, contact details, passport details, etc.) solely for the purpose of obtaining insurance quotes and issuing policies. Data is handled according to our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and EU GDPR regulation. We never sell or share personal data with third parties other than licensed insurance providers required for policy issuance.</p>

        <h2>10. No Financial or Legal Advice</h2>
        <p>Information provided on this website or via email/WhatsApp is for insurance facilitation purposes only and does not constitute legal, immigration, or financial advice. Clients should confirm requirements with official authorities when necessary.</p>
