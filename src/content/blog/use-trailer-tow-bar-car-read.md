The Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport issued new regulations affecting vehicle owners with trailers or tow-bars in Greece.

## Trailer Registration

All trailers will be considered to be separate vehicles from now on, and will require their own separate registration document. New registration documents had to be issued by December 12, 2020, with old tow notes no longer valid. Vehicle owners must carry both registration documents while driving.

## Tow-Bar Standards

All tow-bars must now be retractable or detachable and cannot protrude when not in use. Existing vehicles with fixed, non-removable bars must be replaced. When inactive, tow-bars must either be detached or folded flush with the bumper.

## Vehicle Inspections (KTEO/MOT)

Vehicles equipped with fixed, non-retractable tow-bars will fail inspections. Owners must schedule re-inspection within one month of failing.
