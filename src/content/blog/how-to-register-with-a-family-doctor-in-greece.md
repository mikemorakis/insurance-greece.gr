## Registering with a Family Doctor in Greece

If you're living in Greece and have access to the public healthcare system (EOPYY), registering with a family doctor is an important step. Here's how to do it.

## Who Can Register?

You can register with a family doctor if you:

- Have an AMKA number (Greek social security number)

- Are insured through EOPYY (the Greek public health system)

- Are a resident in Greece

## How to Register

### Step 1: Get Your AMKA

If you don't already have one, you'll need to get your AMKA number first. You can do this at your local KEP (Citizens Service Centre) or at an EFKA office.

### Step 2: Find a Family Doctor

You can search for available family doctors in your area through the EOPYY website or by visiting your local health center (Kentro Ygeias). Not all doctors have availability, so you may need to check several options.

### Step 3: Register Online or In Person

Registration can be done:

- Online through the EOPYY website (requires TaxisNet credentials)

- In person at a KEP office

- At your local health center

### Step 4: Confirmation

Once registered, you'll receive confirmation. Your family doctor will then be your first point of contact for non-emergency medical issues and can refer you to specialists when needed.

## Why Is This Important?

Having a registered family doctor is important for:

- Accessing prescription medications at subsidized prices

- Getting referrals to specialists

- Having a medical professional who knows your health history

## Private Health Insurance

Even with access to public healthcare, many expats in Greece choose to have private health insurance for faster access to specialists and private hospitals. [Learn more about health insurance options](/insurance-services/health-insurance/) or [contact us](/contact/) for advice.
