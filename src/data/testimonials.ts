    text: 'Having just taken out car, house and finally health insurance, I would certainly recommend Insurance-Greece.com. It has been a very straightforward procedure thanks to their kindess and patience. Not having a copy of the policies in English is very difficult but they always take the time to explain anything and everything – and never duck a question!',

    text: 'Stavros Tsichlis from Insurance-Greece.com proved to be a total and consummate professional when I enquired about home and vehicle insurance. He is linguistically skilled and with his wide knowledge of insurance he was able to reassure and guide me in excellent English through the complexities of Greek insurance – both within Greece and when traveling across Europe from Greece to the UK by car and return. His advice was without prejudice or pressure and I would certainly recommend Insurance-Greece.com without reserve.',
