## Car Insurance Tips for Expats in Greece

Navigating car insurance in Greece can be confusing, especially if you're used to a different system. Here are our top tips for getting the right coverage.

## Understand the Types of Coverage

### Third Party Only (Basic)

This is the minimum legal requirement in Greece. It covers damage you cause to other people and their property, but NOT damage to your own vehicle. This is often called "civil liability" (αστική ευθύνη).

### Third Party Fire and Theft

Adds coverage for if your car is stolen or damaged by fire. A popular middle-ground option.

### Comprehensive (Mixed/Full)

Covers damage to your own vehicle as well, including accidents that are your fault. This is recommended for newer or more valuable vehicles.

## Key Tips

### 1. Consider Your Vehicle's Value

For older vehicles with low market value, comprehensive coverage might not be cost-effective. But for newer vehicles, the additional premium for comprehensive coverage is usually worth it.

### 2. Check What's Included

Greek policies can vary significantly in what additional coverage they include. Things like roadside assistance, legal protection, and cover for natural disasters may or may not be included. Always read the policy details.

### 3. Understand Your Excess

The excess (απαλλαγή) is the amount you pay towards any claim. A higher excess usually means a lower premium, but make sure you can afford to pay it if you need to claim.

### 4. Declare Modifications

If you've modified your vehicle in any way (tow bars, alloy wheels, engine modifications), you must declare these to your insurer. Failure to do so could invalidate your policy.

### 5. Keep Your No-Claims Bonus

If you've had insurance elsewhere, you may be able to transfer your no-claims bonus to Greece. Provide documentation of your claims history to potentially get a discount.
