## Health Insurance Tips for Expats in Greece

Health insurance is one of the most important types of coverage for expats living in Greece. Here are our top tips for choosing the right policy.

## Public vs Private Healthcare

Greece has both public and private healthcare systems. While the public system (EOPYY) is available to those who contribute through employment, many expats prefer private health insurance for:

- Shorter waiting times

- English-speaking doctors

- Access to private hospitals and clinics

- More comfortable facilities

## Key Considerations

### 1. Inpatient vs Outpatient Coverage

Inpatient coverage is for hospital stays and surgeries. Outpatient covers doctor visits, tests, and prescriptions. Some policies only cover inpatient. Make sure you understand what level of coverage you need.

### 2. Pre-Existing Conditions

Most health insurance policies have waiting periods or exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Be completely honest on your application, as failing to disclose conditions can result in claims being denied.

### 3. Age Limits

Some policies have upper age limits for new customers, and premiums increase with age. If you're over 60, options may be more limited, but there are policies available for older expats.

### 4. Geographic Coverage

Do you want coverage only in Greece, throughout Europe, or worldwide? This affects both the premium and your options when traveling.

### 5. Direct Billing vs Reimbursement

Some policies have agreements with hospitals for direct billing, meaning you don't pay upfront. Others require you to pay and claim back later. Direct billing is more convenient but may limit your choice of providers.

## Our Recommendation

We recommend reviewing your health insurance needs carefully and considering factors like your age, health status, and how often you travel. We can help you compare options from different insurers to find the right fit.
