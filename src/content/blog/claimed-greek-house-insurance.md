This article shares practical experience from someone who filed a house insurance claim in Greece. Written by Stavros Tsichlis, an insurance advisor, it walks readers through the entire claims process.

## Immediate Action Required

The most critical step involves reporting the break-in to police immediately. The police will ask you for details as to what happened and if there are items missing. Police reports are mandatory for claim processing. When listing stolen items, take time to be thorough and accurate, as insurers base compensation on this declaration.

## Building Damage Coverage

Coverage typically includes structural damage such as broken windows, doors, and lock replacements caused by burglars.

## Time Away From Home

Most Greek insurers limit coverage for contents when policyholders are abroad. Typical limits range from 45 to 90 days continuously. Extended absences may result in claim denial unless a neighbor or maintenance company monitors the property.

## High-Value Items

Cash and jewelry face restrictions or exclusion. Jewelry requires safe box storage embedded in walls for coverage. Items exceeding €2,500–€3,000 need advance declaration to insurers.

## Excluded Property

Pools, parking spots, pergolas, storage sheds, trees, fences, and exterior items like bicycles typically fall outside standard coverage.

## Documentation Matters

Receipts for replacement items determine final payouts. Without proof of new purchases, insurers pay depreciated values instead of full replacement cost.

## Settlement Process

Review compensation letters carefully before signing, as signatures constitute claim acceptance and file closure.

## The Insurance Advisor's Role

Having a dedicated advisor during claims provides personalized support beyond automated systems.
