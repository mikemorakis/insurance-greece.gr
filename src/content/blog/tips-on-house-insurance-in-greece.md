## House Insurance Tips for Property Owners in Greece

Whether you've bought a holiday home or relocated permanently, home insurance is essential protection for your Greek property. Here's what you need to know.

## What Does Home Insurance Cover?

Greek home insurance policies typically cover:

- **Building damage** - Fire, storm, flood, earthquake

- **Contents** - Furniture, appliances, personal belongings

- **Third party liability** - If someone is injured on your property

- **Theft** - Burglary and theft of contents

## Key Tips

### 1. Earthquake Coverage

Greece is in an earthquake zone. Make sure earthquake damage is included in your policy - it's not always automatic and may be an add-on.

### 2. Accurate Valuation

Ensure your building and contents are insured for the correct value. Underinsurance means you may not receive the full amount needed to repair or replace. Over-insurance means you're paying more premium than necessary.

### 3. Unoccupied Property

If your property is empty for extended periods (common for holiday homes), check your policy terms. Many policies have restrictions on coverage for unoccupied properties, sometimes as short as 30 days.

### 4. Security Requirements

Some policies require minimum security measures (certain types of locks, alarm systems) to be in place. Make sure you meet these requirements, or claims could be denied.

### 5. Contents Away from Home

Some policies cover contents even when temporarily away from the property. This can be useful for valuable items you take with you.

## Mortgage Requirements

If you have a mortgage on your Greek property, your lender will typically require you to have buildings insurance at minimum. The policy may need to note the lender's interest.
