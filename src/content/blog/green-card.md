When traveling abroad with a vehicle, proper documentation is essential. One crucial document is the Green Card (now white in appearance). Greek law prohibits driving without vehicle insurance, and border crossings require proper documentation. Here are three key facts about Green Cards for international travel.

## Fact 1: Green Card Eligibility Requirements

The only prerequisite for obtaining a Green Card is having active vehicle insurance. The process is straightforward:

- **Option A:** Request from your insurance company at no cost

- **Option B:** Obtain at border customs (approximately €10 fee)

Important considerations include declaring all potential drivers who will operate the vehicle abroad, such as family members or partners. Required documents include the insurance policy, Green Card, ID, and driver's license.

## Fact 2: Green Card Coverage Limitations

The Green Card does not extend your existing insurance policy. Instead, it guarantees third-party liability coverage and confirms compliance with international requirements. It verifies your home country insurance and provides "the most basic of all coverages, 3rd Party Liability." Optional roadside assistance may be purchased separately.

## Fact 3: Geographic Validity

The Green Card functions differently than identification documents. Only 47 participating nations in the Green Card System accept it. Validity matches your insurance policy duration—expiration occurs simultaneously.

## Pre-Travel Verification Checklist

- Confirm accuracy of card information

- Verify expiration date extends beyond return date

- Confirm travel route avoids non-participating countries
