## Can You Drive with Flip Flops in Greece?

This is a question we get asked surprisingly often! Many people assume that driving in flip flops or barefoot is illegal in Greece, but the law is not as straightforward as you might think.

## The Legal Position

Technically, there is no specific law in Greece that prohibits driving while wearing flip flops, sandals, or even barefoot. However, the Greek traffic code does require drivers to maintain proper control of their vehicle at all times.

If the police believe that your footwear (or lack of it) is affecting your ability to drive safely, you could be fined for not being in proper control of your vehicle. This is a judgment call by the officer on the scene.

## Insurance Implications

This is where it gets more serious. While driving in flip flops might not be specifically illegal, if you're involved in an accident and it's determined that your footwear contributed to the accident, your insurance company might use this as grounds to reduce or deny your claim.

Insurance policies typically require you to take reasonable care when driving. Wearing inappropriate footwear could be seen as failing to meet this requirement.

## Our Recommendation

We recommend keeping a pair of proper driving shoes in your car, especially during summer when the temptation to drive in beach footwear is highest. It's a simple precaution that could save you a lot of trouble in the event of an accident.
