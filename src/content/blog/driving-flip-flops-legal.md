The article examines whether driving with flip flops is permitted in Greece and discusses associated safety concerns.

## Legal Status in Greece

The Greek legal framework doesn't explicitly prohibit flip flop driving. However, Article 13 requires that "the driver of each vehicle is obliged to have complete freedom of movement in order to act correctly in the necessary handling of the vehicle." This leaves enforcement to police discretion. If cited, drivers face a €100 fine and potential 30-day license suspension.

## Safety Statistics

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), approximately 16,000 crashes annually occur due to improper pedal pressure from inappropriate footwear or bare feet. Flip flops can interfere with brake and accelerator pedals, creating dangerous driving conditions.

## Insurance Implications

Insurance companies may deny coverage if an accident occurs while the driver wore flip flops. One senior executive stated that unsuitable shoes could be considered evidence of negligent driving, potentially leading to coverage cancellation in extreme cases.

## Recommendation

We advise drivers to wear proper footwear that allows comfortable and safe vehicle operation, especially during summer travel season.
